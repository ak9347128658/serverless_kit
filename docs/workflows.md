# Workflows (state machines)

A workflow chains functions with branching, retries, error handling, waits, parallel branches and fan-out. You define it once in `pskit.yml`, and pskit runs it:

- **natively**, as AWS Step Functions (ASL), Google Cloud Workflows or (opt-in, `engine: native`) Azure Logic Apps;
- on the **embedded engine** on every other target, inside an auto-generated orchestrator function (on premises that function runs inside the long-lived host, so the workflow is not cut off by a function timeout);
- **locally** with `pskit workflow run`, using the same engine.

```yaml
functions:
  validate: {handler: app.orders.validate}
  charge:   {handler: app.orders.charge}
  notify:   {handler: app.orders.notify}

workflows:
  order-pipeline:
    description: Validate, charge and notify
    start_at: Validate
    states:
      Validate:
        type: task
        function: validate
        retry: [{errors: [TimeoutError], max_attempts: 3, interval_seconds: 2, backoff_rate: 2}]
        catch: [{errors: [ValueError], next: Rejected}]
        next: Route
      Route:
        type: choice
        choices:
          - {variable: "$.amount", gt: 1000, next: ManualReview}
        default: Charge
      ManualReview: {type: wait, seconds: 3600, next: Charge}
      Charge:       {type: task, function: charge, result_path: "$.payment", next: Notify}
      Notify:       {type: task, function: notify, result_path: null, end: true}
      Rejected:     {type: fail, error: OrderRejected, cause: validation failed}
```

Task handlers receive `event.type == "workflow"` and the state input in `event.data`. Whatever they return is the task result:

```python
def validate(event, ctx):
    order = dict(event.data)
    if order.get("amount", 0) <= 0:
        raise ValueError("amount must be positive")   # matched by catch: errors: [ValueError]
    return {**order, "valid": True}
```

## Workflow keys

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `start_at` | — | required; must name a state |
| `states` | — | map of state name → state |
| `description` | `""` | |
| `engine` | `auto` | `auto` = native where supported (aws, gcp), embedded elsewhere (also on Azure, where native is opt-in); `native` errors on clouds without native support; `embedded` forces the engine everywhere |
| `timeout` | — | AWS `TimeoutSeconds`; embedded orchestrator function timeout (capped at the provider's max), also enforced by the embedded engine (the run ends `TIMED_OUT`) |
| `options.type` | `STANDARD` | AWS only: `STANDARD` or `EXPRESS` |
| `options.http` | `true` | embedded only: `false` removes the orchestrator's HTTP trigger |
| `options.sync` | `true` | Azure native only: `false` drops the `Response` actions, so the caller gets `202` at once instead of the output |

All `next` / `default` / `catch.next` targets are checked to exist, and every `function` must be defined under `functions`.

## State types

| `type` | Fields | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `task` | `function`, `next`/`end`, `input_path`, `result_path`, `retry`, `catch`, `timeout_seconds` | call a function |
| `choice` | `choices` (rules with `next`), `default` | branch; with no match and no default the run fails with `States.NoChoiceMatched` |
| `wait` | `seconds` or `seconds_path`, `next`/`end` | sleep |
| `pass` | `result`, `result_path`, `next`/`end` | inject a value (or pass the input through) |
| `parallel` | `branches` (each `{start_at, states}`), `result_path`, `next`/`end` | run branches concurrently; result is a list (one item per branch) |
| `map` | `items_path`, `iterator` (`{start_at, states}`), `max_concurrency`, `result_path`, `next`/`end` | run the iterator for each item; result is a list |
| `succeed` | — | finish successfully with the current data |
| `fail` | `error`, `cause` | finish with an error |

`task`, `wait`, `pass`, `parallel` and `map` without `next` are treated as `end: true`. Every state can have a `comment`.

### Data flow

The JSON path dialect is `$`, `$.a.b`, `$.items[0]`, `$['key']`.

- `input_path` selects the part of the state input that is passed to the task (default `$`, the whole input).
- `result_path` says where the result goes in the state's data:
  - `$` (default) replaces the data with the result;
  - `$.payment` stores the result under that key and keeps the rest;
  - `null` discards the result and passes the input through.

### Choice rules

```yaml
choices:
  - {variable: "$.status", equals: "paid", next: Ship}
  - {variable: "$.amount", gte: 100, next: Review}
  - and:
      - {variable: "$.country", in: [IN, US]}
      - not: {variable: "$.vip", equals: true}
    next: Standard
  - or: [{variable: "$.email", is_present: false}, {variable: "$.email", is_null: true}]
    next: AskEmail
```

| Operator | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `equals`, `not_equals` | equality (any JSON type; `equals: null` checks for null) |
| `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte` | numeric or string comparison |
| `in` | value is one of a list |
| `contains` | substring / membership |
| `matches` | glob pattern (`*`, `?`) |
| `is_null` | `true` / `false` |
| `is_present` | the path exists (`true` / `false`) |
| `and`, `or`, `not` | combinators; can be nested |

A rule whose variable is missing or of the wrong type evaluates to false instead of failing.

### Retry and catch

```yaml
retry:
  - errors: [TimeoutError, ConnectionError]   # exception class names; "*" or "States.ALL" = any
    max_attempts: 3                            # default 3
    interval_seconds: 1                        # default 1
    backoff_rate: 2.0                          # default 2.0
    max_delay_seconds: 60                      # optional cap
catch:
  - errors: ["*"]
    next: HandleError
    result_path: "$.error"                    # default; stores {"error": "...", "cause": "..."}
```

Error names are the **Python exception class names** your handler raises (e.g. `ValueError`). The first matching retrier is used. When retries are exhausted, the first matching catcher routes to its `next` state. Without a match the run fails.

## Engines

| Provider | Engine | What gets deployed |
|---|---|---|
| aws | native | `aws_sfn_state_machine` (ASL) + an IAM role that can invoke the task Lambdas |
| gcp | native | `google_workflows_workflow`; tasks are OIDC-authenticated HTTP calls to the functions |
| azure (`engine: native`) | native | a Logic App (`azurerm_logic_app_workflow` + HTTP request trigger + actions); tasks call `/_pskit/invoke/<function>` with the function key |
| all others (or `engine: embedded`) | embedded | an extra function `<workflow>-orchestrator` that runs the state machine and calls task handlers **in-process** (same bundle) |

### Embedded orchestrator

- Invoke it with `POST /workflows/<workflow>` and the JSON input as the body (when the provider supports HTTP and `options.http` isn't `false`), or invoke it directly.
- Every run has an `execution_id`. On a cloud the response is synchronous: `{"execution_id": ..., "workflow": ..., "status": "SUCCEEDED", "output": ..., "duration_ms": ...}`, or HTTP 500 `{"execution_id": ..., "status": "FAILED", "error": ..., "cause": ...}`.
- On premises the run is tracked by the host. `POST /workflows/<workflow>` answers `202` with the `execution_id` at once (`?wait=true` returns the result), and the run can be listed, followed and cancelled. See [Workflow executions](workflow-executions.md).
- The **whole run must fit in one function invocation**: total time ≤ the provider's max timeout (e.g. 900 s on AWS/Huawei/Tencent, 600 s on Azure, 120 s on IBM). Long `wait` states don't fit; use a native engine or split the workflow. `pskit validate` warns about this.
- The HTTP route is public when the provider's HTTP is public. Set `options.http: false` for sensitive workflows.

### Compiler notes and limits

- **AWS:** `IntervalSeconds` is rounded to ≥ 1. `map` uses an inline `ItemProcessor`. `contains` compiles to `StringMatches *x*`.
- **GCP:** only the **first** retry rule of a task is used (Cloud Workflows allows one retry policy). `retry`/`catch` are honoured on `task` states only (ignored on `parallel`/`map`, with a warning). Task HTTP timeouts are capped at 1800 s.
- **Azure (Logic Apps):** the state machine runs as an interpreter: an `Until` loop over a `Switch` on the current state, with the data kept as a JSON string variable. The HTTP trigger answers with the output (`200`) or `{"error", "cause"}` (`500`); a synchronous `Response` must come within about 2 minutes, so set `options.sync: false` for long workflows. Only the **first** retry rule of a task is used, as Logic Apps' exponential retry policy (it retries 408/429/5xx responses: the `errors` filter and `backoff_rate` are ignored, intervals are 5 s–1 day, at most 90 retries). `retry`/`catch` work on `task` states only. Task calls time out after 120 s (the Logic Apps limit for outbound HTTP), and `pskit validate` warns when a task function's timeout is longer. `map` iterations run one at a time (`max_concurrency` is ignored). `matches` accepts `abc`, `abc*`, `*abc`, `*abc*` and `*`; other globs are a validation error. `is_present` treats `null` like a missing key. `result_path` can't contain array indexes. Logic Apps allow 8 levels of nesting, so `parallel` states can nest at most three deep and `map` states two deep. A run stops after 5000 states or `timeout` (default 1 hour).

## Commands

```bash
pskit workflow run order-pipeline -i '{"amount": 50}'           # local, embedded engine; wait states skipped
pskit workflow run order-pipeline -i @events/order.json --sleep --history
pskit workflow show order-pipeline                              # compiled for the current provider
pskit workflow show order-pipeline --format asl                 # asl | gcp | json
```

`workflow run` exits with code 2 when the run fails.

Deployed workflows:

```bash
pskit workflow start order-pipeline -i '{"amount": 50}'          # prints the execution_id
pskit workflow executions order-pipeline --status RUNNING
pskit workflow status <execution_id> --watch --history
pskit workflow cancel <execution_id>
```

These work against the on-premises host, AWS Step Functions and Google Cloud Workflows. See [Workflow executions](workflow-executions.md).

Not supported: `Parameters`/`ResultSelector`/`OutputPath`, intrinsic functions, `.sync`/callback service integrations, and timestamp waits. Do that shaping in a small task function instead. Walkthrough: [migrating-from-aws.md](migrating-from-aws.md).
